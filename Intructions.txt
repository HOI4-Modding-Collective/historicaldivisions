More Historical Division Structure Mod

special thanks to:

Military History Visualized

For making a detailed video on what Hearts of Iron 4 divisions would look like if they were historical.

This mod changes the starting division structures of the number of nations in the 1939 scenario. It implements all of the infantry division structures listed in the above 
video. I have also taken a stab at creating more historically accurate armour, mountain, motorized and marine divisions (try not to laugh to much :)). 
There are also templates for later war divisions included which are intended to serve as a guide for players wanting to evolve their divisions in historically accurate ways. 
As the AI at present does not update it's divisions maybe it will also build these as well.  
The 1936 scenario remains unaltered. Furthermore, a number a nations were given additional tech to better represent their technology levels in 1939 and to allow for the
above division structures to exist 

Game mechanic Change:

Due to the fact that many armoured divisions included towed guns in the T.O.Es I have increased the based speed of towed guns to 10 (2 less than motorized units)
